|Goal
a| Provide navigation-relevant, high temporal and spatial resolution sea ice information products to ice going ships. The data needs to be delivered in an easy-to-use user-friendly way which provides interpretation help and allows for easy decision-making even without expert sea ice knowledge. Due to the dynamic nature of moving sea ice, forecasts of the variable conditions are oftentimes mission-critical as well. 
Account for user-specific ice information needs:
* Research ship data support: 
- for long transits (strategic planning)
- very short term tactical navigation to fulfill research goals 
- high update frequency
* Expedition Cruise ship data support: 
- for long transits
- tactical planning
- data handling as easy as possible 
  (crews with limited scientific background)

|Actors
a| 
* Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Center for Polar and Marine Research (Research Institute operating the Icebreaker Polarstern)
* Ponant (Expedition Cruise Operator), specifically the navigation crews
* Various other partners of Drift+Noise that haven't been mentioned in the proposal specifically
* DESIDE software development experts
* DESIDE ice consultant (Drift+Noise)

|Pre-conditions
a| The following data sets need to be available via the DESP platform:
- RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) SAR imagery
- Sentinel-1 (ESA) SAR imagery
- Sea ice drift forecast data (TOPAZ5, neXtSIM)
- ICON wind forecast data 
- Sea ice charts from all the national ice services

|Post-conditions
a| 
. Added value data sets (morphed images)
. Create intermediate data sets (drift forecast trajectories) 
. Validate morphed images based on ship data/feedback
. Include above-mentioned data set into the various DESIDE platforms e.g. PolarTEP

|Normal flow
a| 
. Provide users with preliminary access to the various DESIDE platforms
. Collect their feedback
. Implement feedback

|Notes and issues
a| 
* Implementation into IcySea (contract issue)
* Define areas of interest:
- AWI: Arctic-wide
- Ponant: special interest in data for the journey to the North Pole
* Connect local ship data with image processor
